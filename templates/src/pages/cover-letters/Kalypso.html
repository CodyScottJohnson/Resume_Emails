  Thank you, for taking the time to talk to me today, and for your help throughout last semester.
  I really appreciate all of the time you and the rest of the Kalypso team have put in with information sessions, case competitions and interviews. I recognize this represents a significant time commitment and just wanted to say thank you, it has been an incredibly helpful resource.
