  Thanks again for all of your help during the Adobe Analytics Challenge. I really appreciated the opportunity to come into the Adobe offices and meet with everyone. I was inspired with the passion and drive everyone had for the work they were doing.

      <p>I&#39;ve spent the last part of my career trying to help people without analytical backgrounds make more data driven decisions. The desire to bridge the gap between those who make decisions that could benefit from statistical analysis and those who know and understand data is what drove me to go back to school to pursue an MBA. Throughout the competition, as I watched members of my team and other teams without a statistical or technical background be able to interact with and draw insights from the data, I was continually impressed by the progress Adobe has made through its&#39; software in bridging the gap that brought me back to school.

        You mentioned during the contest that Adobe often hires contestants from the analytics competition. I was hoping you could help me better understand what that recruiting process looks like, who should I be talking to, what postings should I be looking for, or what skills should I be developing that would enable me to make the greatest impact at Adobe. Any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated.
      </p>
