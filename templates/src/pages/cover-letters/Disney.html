  I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to talk to me yesterday.
  I really appreciate your willingness to provide me with information on both positions and help me figure out which one might be a better fit for me. It was also great getting to hear your own experience working at Disney. It was particularly interesting to hear about Disneyâ€™s quiet but confident approach towards technology.
