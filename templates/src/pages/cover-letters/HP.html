  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me yesterday and putting up with my network issues.
  I really appreciated your candor and your willingness to talk about the work being done by the team. It was incredibly helpful to get a better picture of what your trying to do and the work I would be doing. Your answers were honestly some of the most helpful I have received during an interview, and I regret that I cut our time short do to my inability to maintain a stable internet connection.
