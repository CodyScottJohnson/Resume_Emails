  Thanks again for all of your help during the Adobe Analytics Challenge. I really appreciated the opportunity to come into the Adobe offices and meet with everyone. I was inspired with the passion and drive everyone had for the work they were doing.

        Thanks for making the time to meet with me last week; it was great speaking with you. I wanted to touch bases quickly on the opportunity you mentioned to work with Disney and the Void during the school year. I'm very interested in the work that Disney has been doing with the Void. It sounds like your next steps are data related which plays well with my background. I'd love to move forward with this and see how I can continue contributing to the work Disney is doing. Let me know what it looks like on your end.
