  Sorry this is a little belated, I just want to say thank you for taking the time to talk with me on Friday.
  I really appreciated your willingness to allow so much time for me to ask questions, particularly your willingness to let me re-ask one of your own questions. It was great getting to hear your thoughts on the question and to get someone else’s perspective on the role that digital products play in their lives. I’ve always used Weather Underground for the detailed hourly wind and precipitation breakdown to figure out if I’m going to get caught out in a storm when in the mountains, and had never noticed the comparison to the previous day, it’s definitely something I’ll pay more attention to in the future.
