    Thanks for making the time to meet with me before I left California. It was great speaking with you and getting to
    see your enthusiasm for technology at Disney.
    I wanted to touch bases quickly on the opportunity you mentioned to work with Disney and the Void during the school
    year. I've been incredibly impressed by the work that Disney has been doing with the Void. It sounds like your next
    steps are centered around data which plays well with my background. I would be very interested in moving forward
    with this and seeing how I can continue contributing to the work Disney is doing. I'd love to talk about next steps
    when you get a minute. Let me know what things look like on your end.

          We met briefly in Ben Havey's office while I was with Disney over the summer. Thanks again for making the
          time to meet with me. It was great speaking with you and Ben and getting to see your enthusiasm for
          technology at Disney.
